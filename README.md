# Simplicial-Complexes
a library about Simplicial Complexes in Lean 4 language

We take the part of the code of the auxiliary theorem `lemma subset_of_edges` from Clara L¨oh's Notes about Abstract Simplicial Complex https://loeh.app.uni-regensburg.de/mapa/main.pdf

Todo : 
- importing part of Clara Loh's code to Lean 4

    -[] Euler characteristic
    
    -[] simplicial homology
